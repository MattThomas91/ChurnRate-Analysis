Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python and necessities to use Apache Spark in a python workstation. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.


Project Motivation

For this project, I was interestested in using an example music streaming service dataset to explore how we can predict if users will downgrade or cancel their service.  This is popularly known as "churn".


File Descriptions

There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above exploration. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  The Sparkify json data file will need to be unzipped before using the ChurnAnalysis code for analysis.


Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available on Medium (https://medium.com/@matthewaaronthomas9/predicting-churnrate-for-a-music-service...).
